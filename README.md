Project by Anders G. Kristensen (tzk942) and Karl P. NÃ¸rgaard (cth443)

## Report
The report in file *"final_report.pdf"* is optional reading if one is interested in the reasoning behind the implementations. It contains the setup of the project as well as some of the considerations that were made. Finally, the project's main findings are showcased along with comments. If one just wants to see the main plots, these can be found in the file *"allPlots.pdf"*.

## Source code
The source code is in the Notebooks: *"fixed_charge_network_flow_recommended.ipynb"* and *"fixed_charge_network_flow_reformulation.ipynb"* and requires a valid Gurobi license to run. We recommend running the solution in *"fixed_charge_network_flow_recommended.ipynb"* while *"fixed_charge_network_flow_reformulation.ipynb"* can be used for comparison.
